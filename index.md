## About Me

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at the Medical Robotics Lab, [State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems](http://mais.ia.ac.cn/), [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zengguang Hou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~houzengguang) and Prof. [Xiaohu Zhou](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~xhz). My research primarily focus on developing an intelligent navigation system for image-guided vascular interventions.

Before that, I received my B.S. degree from [the School of Electronic Engineering](https://see.bupt.edu.cn/en/), [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) at Jun. 2022.
